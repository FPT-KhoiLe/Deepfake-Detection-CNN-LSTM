# Deepfake Detection using CNN-LSTM

This repository contains the code and experiments for detecting deepfakes using a hybrid model that combines ResNeXt-50 and LSTM. This project was developed as part of a university DAP project to explore deep learning methods for detecting deepfakes by extracting both spatial and temporal features.

## Introduction

Deepfake technology allows the creation of realistic fake videos by manipulating existing ones. This project aims to detect such manipulations using a deep learning approach that leverages both spatial and temporal features of videos.

## Model Architecture

The model used in this project is a hybrid architecture that combines:

- **ResNeXt-50**: A convolutional neural network (CNN) used for extracting spatial features from video frames.
- **LSTM**: A long short-term memory network used for capturing temporal dependencies between frames.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluating the model includes various deepfake videos. The details of the dataset and how to obtain it can be found in the `data` directory.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To train the model, use the following command:

```bash
python train.py --config config/train_config.yaml
```

To evaluate the model, use:

```bash
python evaluate.py --config config/evaluate_config.yaml
```

For a demo of the model, run:

```bash
python demo.py --video path/to/video.mp4
```

## Experiments

Various experiments were conducted to fine-tune the model and evaluate its performance. The details of these experiments can be found in the `experiments` directory.

## Results

The results of the experiments, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, are documented in the `results` directory.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please fork the repository and submit a pull request.
